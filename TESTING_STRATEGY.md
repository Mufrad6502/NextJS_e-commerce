# 🧪 Testing Strategy Document

This document outlines the testing approach, tool choices, and scaling strategy for automated testing of [demo.vercel.store](https://demo.vercel.store) using Playwright.

---

## 🎯 Goals of the Testing Strategy
- Ensure **critical user journeys** (browse, search, add-to-cart, checkout) are always functional.  
- Provide **fast feedback** during development via regression tests.  
- Enable **scalability** of the test suite as the application grows.  
- Deliver **reliable reporting** and monitoring for both developers and QA engineers.  

---

## 🛠 Tooling Choice

### Playwright (JavaScript)
- Cross-browser support: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit.  
- First-class support for **end-to-end testing** with UI automation.  
- Built-in test runner, parallel execution, and fixtures.  
- Easy **Page Object Model (POM)** implementation for maintainability.  

### CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Automatic test runs on every commit and pull request.  
- Parallel test execution across browsers.  
- HTML reports uploaded as artifacts.  

### Reporting
- **Playwright HTML Reports** for fast debugging.  
- **Optional Allure Reports** for advanced analytics and historical trends.

## 📦 Test Organization

### Project Structure
    ├── fixtures/        # Common test fixtures
    ├── pages/           # Page Object Models (POMs)
    ├── tests/           # Organized test specs
    │   ├── e2e/         # End-to-end critical flows
    │   ├── regression/  # Regression & smoke tests
    ├── reports/         # HTML/Allure reports
    ├── playwright.config.js

### Test Types
1. **Smoke Tests** → Quick checks (homepage loads, cart opens).  
2. **Regression Tests** → Cover stable functionality (navigation, filters, product detail page).  
3. **End-to-End Flows** → Full customer journey (search → product → cart → checkout).  
4. **Responsive Tests** → Desktop vs mobile validation (hamburger menu, layouts).  
5. **Visual Validation** (optional) → Screenshot comparisons for critical UI elements.  
6. **API Tests** (future) → Validate backend endpoints that power products, search, and checkout.

## 🔄 Scaling Strategy

1. **Modular POM Approach**  
   - Each feature has a dedicated Page Object (e.g., `CartPage`, `SearchPage`).  
   - Reuse methods across specs to avoid duplication.  

2. **Tagging & Suites**  
   - Tag tests as `@smoke`, `@regression`, `@critical` for selective execution.  

3. **CI/CD Parallelization**  
   - Run tests in parallel across multiple browsers/projects.  
   - Add **matrix builds** for environments (staging, pre-production, production).  

4. **Data Management**  
   - Use fixtures for dynamic test data.  
   - Add mocks for unstable APIs to reduce flakiness.  

5. **Monitoring & Metrics**  
   - Track **pass/fail trends** in reports.  
   - Measure **average runtime** of test suites.  
   - Monitor **flaky test frequency** → set thresholds and auto-retries.  
   - Use CI metrics (e.g., GitHub Actions Insights) to track test performance over time.
